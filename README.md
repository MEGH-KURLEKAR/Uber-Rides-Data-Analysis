# 🚖 Uber Rides Data Analysis Using Python

This project explores ride data from Uber to uncover trends, usage patterns, and actionable insights using Python. It demonstrates real-world data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations using tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

## 📌 Overview

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key patterns in Uber ride data such as:

- Peak demand hours and days of the week
- Seasonal and hourly trends in ride frequency
- Geospatial pickup patterns
- User behavior insights to support operational decision-making

## 🧪 Key Features

- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identification of busiest hours and days for Uber rides
- Time series visualizations of daily and hourly demand
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for temporal analysis
